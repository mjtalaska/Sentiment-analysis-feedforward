# Sentiment-analysis-feedforward
This project consists of analyzing sentiment through a Feedforward network instead of a Recurrent one.  
In order to get better results, the sentences are divided into ngrams, and then, using tf-idf, they are changed into arrays of numbers. 
In an attempt to improve the overall performance of the Feedforawrd Neural Network I have implemented a feature selection algorithm.

Due to the fact that the provided dataset is rather small, the overall accuracy is about 75% - 80%.
